#+TITLE: Lab II. Basic dialogue management

* Getting started with development environment

** Preflight step 1. Create Azure account and enable speech services
1. Apply for free student credits
   https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/. You should be
   able to login with your GU account.
2. Make sure that you are logged into the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/).
3. Create a *Resource group* (you can use search field):
   - Subscription: *Azure for students*
   - Resource group: any name
   - Region: *(Europe) North Europe*
4. Create a *Speech service*:
   - Name: any name
   - Subscription: *Azure for students*
   - Location: *(Europe) North Europe*
   - Pricing tier: *Free (F0)*
   - Resource group: group name from the previous step
5. Within your Speech Service go to: *Resourse management → Keys and
   Endpoint* and save your KEY 1.
   
** Preflight step 1. Run the example project
1. [[https://nodejs.org/en/download/][Download and install NodeJS]] (LTS version).
2. Fork and clone the example project (this project):
   https://github.com/GU-CLASP/speechstate-lt2216. Keep an eye on the
   changes in the repo, it is still work in progress!
3. Install *yarn dependency manager* and all the dependencies:
   #+begin_src
   npm install --global yarn
   yarn
   #+end_src
4. Configure your environment. Modify the ~.env~ file in the root
   folder, subsitute ~<AZURE KEY1>~ with your Azure KEY 1.  Note: you
   can use other language, e.g. ~sv-SE~ if it is supported by your
   application.
5. Run the project:
   #+begin_src sh
   yarn start
   #+end_src
6. Your browser will open the page http://localhost/speechstate-lt2216.
7. Unblock the pop-up window to see the state. 

** Preflight step 3. Depoying the app
1. Open ~package.json~ and change the value of ~homepage~ to
   ~https://localhost/<your_github_repository>~
2. Build and deploy the app:
   #+begin_src sh
   yarn run deploy
   #+end_src
3. The app will be available at
   https://<your_github_username>.github.io/<your_github_repository>

*Note: Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any issues with preflight steps.*

* Assignment
- Task 1 ("appointment") :: Implementation of the finite state machine.
- Task 2 ("intents") :: Implement an intent-based menu.
- VG part :: Improve your app.

** Task 1. "Appointment"
#+CAPTION: Flowchart for creating an appointment
[[./img/flow.svg]]

In this task you will need to implement the flowchart above.

I have created a starting point for you, so you basically can use the
project that you forked before:
- In ~./src/index.tsx~ change the ~dmMachine~ import to:
  #+begin_src js
  import { dmMachine } from "./dmAppointment";
  #+end_src
- You will need to edit the state chart in ~./src/dmAppointment.ts~
- To extend your context, make appropriate changes in
  ~./src/react-app-env.d.ts~
- You will need to extend the grammar (~const grammar~) to
  understand more titles, times and dates.
- You will also need to create a similar grammar to understand "yes"
  and "no", but also "of course", "no way" etc.

** Task 2. "Knowledge base"
In this task you will need to interact with [[https://duckduckgo.com/api][DuckDuckGo Instant Answer
API]] to get information about famous people that you (probably) would
like to meet.


*** Invoking API from XState
1. Use the invocation in order to get the result from the API: https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/communication.html#invoking-promises
2. The interface with the API is already implemented in the bottom of
   ~dmAppointment.ts~.
3. You will need to implement appropriate actions and transitions for
   both ~onDone~ and ~onError~ events.

*** Modifying the flow of the dialogue
#+CAPTION: Full appointment flowchart
[[./img/full-flow.svg]]

1. You would need to have a "main menu" prompting a for an action that
   user would like to do. There are two alternatives: "create a
   meeting" and "who is X".
2. In the latter case the input should be parsed and X should be
   extracted and sent to the API.
3. Based on the responce from the API, tell the user about the person,
   and ask if they would like to meet them. You might need to create
   additional contextual attributes to store your data.
4. If they would like to meet them, set the title of the meeting to
   "meeting with X" and proceed with asking about the day of the
   meeting (see the flowchart above).


** VG part. Improvements
1. Write a report which will describe errors and limitation of your
   app.
2. Try to fix some of them and briefly describe your solution in the
   report.

* Submission
- G part :: submit two links:
  - link to your forked repo
  - URL of the deployed app
- VG part :: include the report in your repository. Please name it
  ~lab2VG.pdf~ (can be also Markdown or Org-mode file, but not Word).
